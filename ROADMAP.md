# mac-cleaner roadmap

This is the autonomous development loop's compass. Each iteration: pick the first
unchecked item, complete it to its **verifiable goal** via the `/loop` workflow
(test-first → clippy/fmt → deletion-safety-reviewer if deletion logic changes →
verifier → PR → CI green → merge), check it off here, then start the next.

**Production-done = every item below checked.** (A native GUI is explicitly out
of scope for the first production release; this milestone is a complete, safe CLI.)

## Done
- [x] Safety substrate + Claude Code harness (PR #1)
- [x] Age-based cleanup filter `--older-than-days` (PR #2)
- [x] `--json` structured scan output (PR #3)
- [x] Cleaner-category registry + Homebrew downloads (PR #4)
- [x] Large-old-files finder (`--min-size`) (PR #5)
- [x] Startup/login-items inspector (`macclean login-items`) (PR #6)
- [x] Property tests for the safety kernel (proptest) (PR #7)
- [x] CI/release hardening (checkout@v5, release artifact, badge) (PR #8)
- [x] Docs + v0.1.0 (README, CHANGELOG, tag) (PR #9)

## Descoped
- [~] Empty-Trash cleaner — **descoped.** `~/.Trash` is already a first-class
  allowlist root + category, so `scan`/`clean` already cover it; a dedicated
  emptier is largely redundant. (The one nuance — items already in the Trash
  want permanent disposal rather than re-trashing — can be folded into the
  category model later if needed.)

## Backlog (in order)
_All backlog items complete — v0.1.0 shipped. 🎉_
